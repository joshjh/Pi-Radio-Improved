Just to be clear, this is NOT all my own work.  I have modified the radio example that came with the pifacecad library. 
It was modifed to use pulse audio for output, with different stations.  I have also added a suspend function instead of being 
able to kill the python process, and a lcd ticker to display longer messages, among other small changes.  I've posted it here incase someone finds it useful.
